	Create --index option. This way some sort of index numbers will appear
	in front of all the read bytes. Might be handy with referencing.

	The option is named --byte-count instead of --index.

	Write a decent manual page.

2006-05-30: 5 (2006-05-30)
	Release the whole software.

2006-05-30: 4 (2006-05-30)
	Setup a nice website and mailing list.

	Waited with a mailing list untill some users demand it.

	Add --byte-delay option. This creates a delay between the sending of each
	byte in a line. Idea courtesy of Michiel van Dam.
